The documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/r2d2-oracle/).

Oracle support for the r2d2 connection pool.
This fits in between the [r2d2](https://crates.io/crates/r2d2) connection manager and [oracle](https://crates.io/crates/oracle) database driver crates.

## Usage
See the documentation of r2d2 for the details on how to use the connection pool.

```rust
use std::thread;
use r2d2_oracle::OracleConnectionManager;

fn main() {
    let manager = OracleConnectionManager::new("user", "password", "localhost");
    let pool = r2d2::Pool::builder()
         .max_size(15)
         .build(manager)
         .unwrap();
    
    for _ in 0..20 {
        let pool = pool.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let conn = pool.get().unwrap();
            // use the connection
            // it will be returned to the pool when it falls out of scope.
        });
    }
}
```

If you want to use chrono data types, enable the `chrono` feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
r2d2-oracle = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["chrono"] }
```

## Changelog
For the changelog please see the dedicated [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Current Status of the Crate & Roadmap to v1.0.0
This is the initial release of the crate and has not yet been proven in production. Nevertheless: the crate is very small so not many problems are expected.
The precondition for releasing v1.0.0 is that both `r2d2` and `oracle` have released their v1.0.0.

## Alternatives to `r2d2-oracle`
You may also want to consider the following alternatives to this crate, depending on your use-cases:
* Starting with version 0.5.5 the [`oracle`](https://crates.io/crates/oracle) provides buit-in connection pooling support
* There is an `async` ([`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)-based) version of `r2d2`, [`bb8`](https://crates.io/crates/bb8) and a corresponding [`bb8-oracle`](https://crates.io/crates/bb8-oracle) fork of `r2d2-oracle` exists

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.54 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.
